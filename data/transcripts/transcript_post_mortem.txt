[14:00] Maria: Let's start with the post-mortem for the outage on Saturday.
[14:01] Dev: The root cause was a misconfigured firewall rule during the new deployment.
[14:02] Maria: Can we add this to our Confluence RCA page?
[14:03] Dev: Sure, I’ll write it up by end of day.
[14:04] Sanjay: We should automate firewall rule validation.
[14:05] Maria: Good point. Please open a Jira task for that, Sanjay.
[14:06] Sanjay: Got it.
[14:07] Maria: Lastly, let’s inform the client about the fix. Rajesh, can you draft the email?
[14:08] Rajesh: I’ll do it right after this call.
