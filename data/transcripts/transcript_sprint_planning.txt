[09:00] Alice: Welcome everyone. Let’s start with the sprint planning. John, did we close the login bug?
[09:01] John: Not yet. I’ll need help from Priya to debug the auth flow.
[09:02] Priya: Sure, I’ll pair with you after lunch today.
[09:03] Alice: Great. Rahul, please create a Jira ticket to track this and assign it to John.
[09:04] Rahul: Will do.
[09:05] Alice: Next up, we need to document the updated onboarding steps in Confluence. Priya, can you handle that?
[09:06] Priya: Yep, I’ll take care of it tomorrow.
[09:07] Alice: Perfect. Anything else?
[09:08] John: I’ll also create a task for refactoring the dashboard code. Probably low priority.
[09:09] Alice: Okay, that’s it then. Let’s sync tomorrow for daily standup.
